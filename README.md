# Proof-of-Existence 

In order to run this you will need MetaMask. This is a very rough product I threw together in a day and I will update it soon, but in the meantime let it server as an example of a quickly built dApp!

Once you clone the repository run:
`npm start`

Set your MetaMask to use the Kovan Test Network.

See `Existence.sol` for the smart contract (hosted on Kovan Testnet).
